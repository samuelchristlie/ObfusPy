**ObfusPy** is a blazing fast obfuscator for Python, making it more challenging to read the source code. **ObfusPy** is designed to be reliable and suitable for almost every kind of code. Please note that the obfuscated file can still be decrypted as the key included in the file. For better protection, it is recommended to use tools like [PyArmor](https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor) instead.

## Features üí™
- **High Performance**: ObfusPy is optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring minimal impact to on your application's performance.
- **Fernet Encryption**: Industry-standard symmetric encryption makes it more challenging to read the source code.
- **Easy Integration**: ObfusPy can obfuscate entire folder in one go which makes it suitable to use on large projects.
- **Open Source**: ObfusPy is fully open source, open for collaboration and contribution from thriving community of developers.
